The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely fail because the `calc()` function expects units on all values.  Another example is mixing `px` and `em` units inconsistently, leading to unexpected sizing across different screen sizes or font sizes.
